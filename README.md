# Chess-Game

This project is a turn-based, chess-like strategy game where two players control teams of characters on a 5x5 grid. Each player commands three types of characters: Pawn, Hero1, and Hero2, each with unique movement rules. The game is implemented with a server-client architecture, using WebSockets for real-time communication and a web-based interface built with React.Made by Shruti Shukla 21BSA10090
